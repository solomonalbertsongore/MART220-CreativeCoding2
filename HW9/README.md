# INCREMENTAL UPDATE

This homework went alright. The best use I could find for the particle system (so far) was to have "mini meteors" spawning in the back for a 
graphical effect. I'm hoping to make it so that when the big ones collide with the ground or player they break up in the future. Also still trying 
to work on the meteor movement right now. Getting closer, but still not fully functional.
