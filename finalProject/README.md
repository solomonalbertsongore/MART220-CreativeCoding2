# INCREMENTAL UPDATE

I'm pretty happy with the final product! I think it'd like to make the meteors an actual class next time, but I'm 
not quite sure how to do that with p5.play. I'd also like the timer to be in seconds in the future. Overall though, 
I think it went well. Thank you for the wonderful class! I feel like my knowledge of classes, arrays, and object 
oriented coding have all increased!
