# INCREMENTAL UPDATE

This homework went better! I love the p5.play library and all it can do 
for you. However I still need to fix my meteor spawning function, the circles up top are still flashing. Now I'm thinking I might be able to do this using groups with p5.play, so we will see. Pretty determined to figure it out myself first. So much to learn! I'm gonna try to continue practicing arrays and classes/objects on my own.
