Assignment 4 was a little better with me. I'm starting to understand arrays better and there potential. 
Currently I am struggling with making the meats actually move down the page now. I think it's going to involve 
using another array to constantly update the position until it gets to the bottom of the screen. I'll be sure to tackle this 
issue as we move on, and hopefully implement it into a class to make calling the meats easier.
