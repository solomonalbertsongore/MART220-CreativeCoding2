# INCREMENTAL UPDATE

Currently I am working on implementing classes and funtions more into my project. Right now I am 
just trying to get a spawner to work that will spawn meteors after 5 seconds go by. Something is 
wrong where all of the circles ("meteors") flash, so hopefully I can fix that next. Then I am going to 
work on trying to get the meteors to fall. Finally I will try to destroy them after they pass a certain 
y coordinate. I am also working on making my code just cleaner and more legible than before. It felt 
super disorganized so I am working on sticking things in functions (after I get them to work) and using more 
classes/arrays.
